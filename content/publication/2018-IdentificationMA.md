abstract = "In this paper we review the existing Bayesian identification techniques for the moving average (MA) models that can be classified as testing based identification and posterior mass function based identification. In order to improve the Bayesian identification of MA models, we present a new Bayesian identification method that is based on the posterior mass function of the MA models order."
