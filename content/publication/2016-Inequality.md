abstract = "There is an increasing global attention to the need to tackle inequality, especially its spatial dimensions. This is because of the negative implications of spatial inequality on the economic growth and poverty. Literature studying spatial inequality is vast and can be generally grouped into two main groups: the first group focuses on the explanatory factors of presence of spatial inequality; and the second group defines the presence of spatial inequality and measures its degree. In order to overcome the limitations of studying only the monetary dimension of spatial inequality, in this study we propose composite indicators that can measure monetary and non-monetary dimensions of spatial inequality. Accordingly, the main objective of this paper is to build two composite indicators; one to measure availability of public services and another to measure socio-economic welfare in order to quantify the degree of multidimensional spatial inequality tied to inhibited districts in Cairo."
