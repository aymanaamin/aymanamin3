# About Me


I am an *Assistant Professor of Statistics* at <a href = "http://www.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en">Faculty of Commerce, Menoufia University, Egypt</a>, with a background on mathematics, theoretical statistics, Bayesian statistics, time series analysis, machine learning, software quality attributes forecasting and statistical programming, along with excellent academic and research experiences. 

I recieved my PhD degree from <a href = "http://www.swin.edu.au/">Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia</a> (in January 2014), and my MSC in Statistics (with excellent degree in October 2009) and BSC in Statistics and Social Science Computing (with excellent degree in June 2006) from <a href = "http://www.feps.eun.eg/">Faculty of Economics and Political Science (FEPS), Cairo University</a>, Egypt. 

Most of my research work is in time series analysis and forecasting methods. I always learn new things in the data science field, and I love working with researchers and data scientists at the global level.
