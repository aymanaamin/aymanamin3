<p>Bradley Efron, at Stanford University, has won the US$80,000 “2018 International Prize in Statistics” for his 1970s work on a method for inferring uncertainty in data, by pioneering the ‘bootstrap’ method for measuring the reliability of small data samples, which are now commonly used across many scientific disciplines.</p>
